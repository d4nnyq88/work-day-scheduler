The Work-Day-Scheduler project is a JavaScript focused project requiring the use of object arrays, functions, loops, and the moment JS api to generate a dynamic application that displays the current work day schedule. The rows of the schedule update in color based on what time the user is veiwing the scheduler. Hours in the past display as gray while the current hour displays as red. Hours in the future will display in green. The user can also add notes to each hour row that is saved to local storage after hitting enter. If the user reloads the page, then any existing local storage will populate the corresponding rows with previous notes.
